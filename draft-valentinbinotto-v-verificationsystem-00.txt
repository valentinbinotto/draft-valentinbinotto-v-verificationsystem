A method to store information via email and to ensure the verification
          of the data and the identification of the version
            draft-valentinbinotto-v-verificationsystem-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method to store information via email and 
   to ensure the verification of the data and identification of the 
   version. As a long-established way of communicating and sharing 
   information and knowledge, email is at the heart of the 
   V verification system (V-VS).

1.  Introduction
   The permanent storage of information and data is absolutely essential
   for a large proportion of Internet users. 
   The name "V verification system" refers to a procedure for sending 
   information via email and providing it with defined version 
   identification attributes in order to guarantee the subsequent 
   traceability of the version history. As this procedure uses the 
   existing email infrastructure, elements such as DKIM, SPF or the 
   encryption of email content can be used to guarantee the integrity of
   the data.

   The V verification system only uses the email infrastructure. This 
   means that the use of the V verification system is not associated 
   with far-reaching changes to the existing infrastructure, and 
   compatibility with legacy infrastructures is guaranteed. Furthermore, 
   these minimal requirements mean that the V verification system is 
   highly flexible and can also be used in environments with limited 
   infrastructure.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The Specification

   The user or administrator who wishes to store data in the sense of
   the V verification system, MUST use their personal individual 
   email account (example: valentin@system.valentin). 

   The user or administrator MUST send the data to a personal, 
   individual email address that is also uniquely assigned to them 
   (example: valentin@admins.valentin). This address MAY be the same as 
   the sender's address, but MAY also be an address that is different 
   from the sender's address. The data SHOULD be in the message body of 
   the email. The message body itself MAY be formatted as Plain text 
   (flat US-ASCII text)([RFC822]) or MIME ([RFC1521]).

   The subject of the email SHOULD include the project name or the name 
   of the data to be stored, the current date in the format YYYYMMDD and 
   the current time in the format HHMM as well as a random value. The 
   subject of an email could therefore look like this: 
   "PROJECTXYYZ202406181520 VB"

   In order to improve the durability of the data or to enable 
   collaboration with other people, these mails MAY also be addressed to 
   a mailing list or to various other people in addition to the personal 
   email address.

   The minimum requirements of the V verification system are described
   in this document. All further details on how the user wishes to use 
   the V verification system are the sole responsibility of the user.

3.  Security Considerations

   document.
